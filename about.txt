1. Different class and model for students.
2. Different class and model for their grades.
3. Different class and model for their attendance.
4. Different class and model for teachers.
5. Teachers will post grades and attendance on the portal.

Students will login and see their grades and attendance. They will also be able 
to see their class schedule and any upcoming events, which will be posted by the 
admin

Attendance will have a table with days as columns and students as rows.
Grades will have a table with subjects as columns and students as rows.
For both cases relation will be formed by student email_id.


# Fix signup schema for teacher and admin
# introduce an course enrollment model, sche,a and router
# new variables made course_instructore for teacher, stu_course instead of course in al 
student related fields 

Calling the enrollment table (yet to be created) in both model and schema but the logic is 
no student that signs up is enrolled in any course. Enrollment is done by the students.

Routers for different subjects will be created in which the student can go and enroll 
in the course. Once the student is enrolled in the course, the student will be able to schedule
their classes and the teacher will be able to post grades and attendance.
also course will be something given by the teacher and the student to mark or see grade 
attendance and the code will check whether the student is even enrolled or not if yes then proceed

So far student, admin and teacher login,signup and all tasks are being performed

Will be adding a courses table which will be handeled by the admin(s) mainly for the 
purpose of registring courses and their details. Admin will be able to add, delete and edit courses
it will also include a column called instructor which will be used to assign a teacher to a 
course. All will be done by the admin.

students will only be able to register to those courses

So I will be adding an updates router for upcoming events such as quizzes and assignments
And some sort of system that will allow students to submit their assignments and quizzes
And also a sytem that can specify or limit teachers so that they can perform actions related
to their respected courses
